Completed Integration. Things to be fixed or changed

- Bullet class implementation needs to be decided, call either by enemy class or use an enemy as a parameter in the constructor to decide what kind of bullet to be fired. 
- Bullet type should use a factory 
- Enemy class should use a factory 
- We are using individual rectangle boxes for each enemy object. This needs to be fixed 
- All hard code should be reviewed 
- Remove timer for enemy objects, to be changed to based on collision
